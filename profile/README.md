# Advanced Broadcast Graphics

Advanced Broadcast Graphics (ABG) is poised to revolutionise the broadcast industry. Our innovative software enables broadcasters get the perfect shot by providing them with a virtual camera that can move to capture any angle they want; close up, from above, point of view, panning across a stage, you name it, it is now possible with our software: 3D-video.

ABG's vision is to transform the world of visual storytelling through innovative technologies and approaches. We believe in a world where creators can capture their reality exactly how they want, and our virtual camera technology is the key to making that vision a reality.

Previous technology allowed production crews to take 3D scans of environments which could then be manipulated in software. However, this was limited to a static snapshot of the world. 3D-video allows a moving scene to be captured as a virtual 3D environment, then manipulated and displayed from any angle. This makes 3D-video truly unique, and all of this works in real time.

Our mission is to provide broadcasters with the tools they need to showcase every moment of a live event in a dynamic and immersive way, from concerts to nature documentaries and beyond. Our commitment to excellence, creativity, and customer satisfaction drives us to deliver the highest quality product to broadcasters, helping them engage audiences and stand out in a competitive media landscape.
